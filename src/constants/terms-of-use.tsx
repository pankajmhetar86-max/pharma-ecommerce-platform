        <p className="mb-4">
          Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (the &quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;)
          carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Company, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates,
          successors and assigns and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives
          (collectively, the &quot;Company Parties&quot;) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the
          Company Parties.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You agree that any dispute between you and any of the Company Parties relating in any way to the Site, the
          services offered on the Site (the &quot;Services&quot;) or these Terms will be resolved by binding
          arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the Company Parties may assert individualized
          claims in small claims court if the claims qualify, remain in such court and advance solely on an individual,
          non-class basis; and (2) you or the Company Parties may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or
          other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
          copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of these
          Terms and shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before you agreed to
          these Terms (in accordance with the preamble) or any prior version of these Terms. This Arbitration Agreement
          does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies
          can, if the law allows, seek relief against the Company Parties on your behalf. For purposes of this
          Arbitration Agreement, &quot;Dispute&quot; will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring
          before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the
          termination of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Company. If that occurs, Company is committed
          to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Company agree that good faith informal efforts
          to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Company
          therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in
          small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via
          videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration
          Agreement (&quot;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&quot;). If you are represented by counsel, your
          counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an
          Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (&quot;Notice&quot;), which shall occur within 45 days after the other
          party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Company that
          you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to:{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${COMPANY_LEGAL_EMAIL}`} className="text-primary hover:underline">
            {COMPANY_LEGAL_EMAIL}
          </a>
          , or by regular mail to {COMPANY_ADDRESS}. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing
          address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number,
          mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be
          held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents
          multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot
          participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a
          party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration
          Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating
          party&apos;s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and
          requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing
          fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process
          required by this section.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.3 Arbitration Rules and Forum.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision
          herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will
          govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If
          the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after
          receipt of your Notice, you and Company agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the
          Dispute through binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of
          this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute
          resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000,
          not inclusive of attorneys&apos; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&apos; most current version of the

          or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
          with a request for arbitration (the &quot;Request&quot;). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone
          number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if
          applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal
          claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an
          accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement
          certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the
          requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel&apos;s
          name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By
          signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel&apos;s knowledge, information, and belief,
          formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for
          any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute
          resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a
          nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3)
          the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely
          have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Unless you and Company otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Subsection 10.2(h) is
          triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the
          arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with
          the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
          alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in
          the applicable JAMS Rules.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You and Company agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be
          kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties&apos; attorneys, accountants, or
          business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents
          exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.4 Authority of Arbitrator.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes subject to arbitration hereunder
          including, without limitation, any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
          formation of this Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following:
          (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled &quot;Waiver of Class or Other
          Non-Individualized Relief,&quot; including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled &quot;Waiver
          of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief&quot; is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such
          subsection entitled &quot;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief&quot; has been breached, shall be
          decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in
          the subsection entitled &quot;Batch Arbitration,&quot; all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees
          shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about
          whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of
          competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration
          Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The
          arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
          parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled &quot;Batch Arbitration.&quot; The arbitrator
          shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator
          shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to
          an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum&apos;s rules, and these Terms (including the
          Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
          essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including
          the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The award of the
          arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court
          having jurisdiction.

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.5 Waiver of Jury Trial.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">

          STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the Company Parties
          are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under
          this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10.2(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an
          individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However,
          there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited
          review.

        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">9.2.6 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION 10.2(h) EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
          OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES
          HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A
          CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF
          MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
          Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
          of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
          party&apos;s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and
          conditions under the Subsection 10.2(h) entitled &quot;Batch Arbitration.&quot; Notwithstanding anything to
          the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to
          any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, &quot;Waiver of Class or Other
          Non-Individualized Relief,&quot; are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief
          (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Company agree that that particular claim or request
          for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and
          may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. All other Disputes shall be
          arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Company from
          participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The parties shall bear their own attorneys&apos; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds
          that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for
          an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you
          or Company need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the
          party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the
          other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees incurred in
          securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either
          party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process,
          is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees

          by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period
          (or as soon as possible thereafter), the JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100
          Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching
          described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each
          batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of
          filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a
          place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (&quot;Batch Arbitration&quot;).

          All parties agree that Requests are of a &quot;substantially similar nature&quot; if they arise out of or
          relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or
          similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the
          disagreeing party shall advise the JAMS, and the JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine
          the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (&quot;Administrative Arbitrator&quot;). In an effort to
          expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative
          Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative
          Arbitrator&apos;s fees shall be paid by Company.

          to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special
          master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited
          calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
